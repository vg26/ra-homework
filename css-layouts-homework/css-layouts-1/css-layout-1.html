                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                    and
                    scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                    leap
                    into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
                    the
                    release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                    publishing
                    software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                    looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                    distribution
                    of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable

                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                    classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
                    professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
                    literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>

                <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
                    born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
                    great
                    explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
                    pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
                    rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
                    pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
                    circumstances
                    occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which
                    of us
                    ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has
                    any
                    right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or
                    one
                    who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
